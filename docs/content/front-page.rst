Core constructs (for functionality):
* **Actor**: Anything that can be either controlled or observed. 
    (e.g. robot, human, object, etc.)
* **Scene**: A common context for actors and controllers. 
    (e.g. a simulation environment, a real-world environment confined to a task, etc.)
* **Engine**: A system that runs one or multiple scenes, stepping through time and managing interactions.
    (e.g. a physics simulator, a real-world deployment system, etc.)

Auxiliary constructs (for convenience):
* **Controller**: The "brain" of an actor, which almost exclusively interacts with the actor.
    (e.g. a neural network, a human operator, etc.)
